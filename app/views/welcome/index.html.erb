<div class="heading" style="text-align:center;">I WRITE CODE</div>
<div class="bodyText"> I first learned about coding from a grade 9 technology textbook, I was really fascinated by
binary numbers and logic gates. I had never used a computer before and I knew about how
the first numbers that were printed to a screen. And in grade ten I found myself staring at a
computer with compiler errors and I have never looked back. I love being able to build
something from scratch that can be used to improve people's lives and make a difference in
the world. <p>I enjoy poetry, jazz and I try to jog as much as I can. I spend my holidays encouraging high school
kids in my neighborhood how to code during the school holidays. I also tutor second and
first year computer science during the school term. My biggest dream is for computer
science to be a more inclusive field and of course hover boards.</p></div>

<div class="bodyText">

... As I began to love myself I understood how much it can offend somebody as I try to force my desires on this person, even though I knew the time was not right and the person was not ready for it, and even though this person was me. Today I call it RESPECT.
</br> As I began to love myself I understood that at any circumstance, I am in the right place at the right time, and everything happens at the exactly right moment, so I could be calm. Today I call it <font color="orange">SELF-CONFIDENCE.</font>
</br>As I began to love myself I freed myself of anything that is no good for my health â€“ food, people, things, situations, and everything the drew me down and away from myself. At first I called this attitude a healthy egoism.Today I know it is <font color="orange">LOVE OF ONESELF.</font>
</br>
As I began to love myself I recognized that my mind can disturb me and it can make me sick. But As I connected it to my heart, my mind became a valuable ally. Today I call this connection <font color="orange">WISDOM OF THE HEART.</font>
</br>
We no longer need to fear arguments, confrontations or any kind of problems with ourselves or others. Even stars collide, and out of their crashing new worlds are born. Today I know <b>THAT IS LIFE !</b>""- Charlie Chaplin
